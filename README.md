# APT source whitelist

This repo contains JSON files for the sources approved for addition in restricted build environments, specifically meant for the `apt` addon in travis-build. You can check here [how to install packages with the APT addon](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/installing-dependencies#Installing-Packages-with-the-APT-Addon).

At this moment, we are unable to continue processing the APT sources requests. If you require a new source, please use `sudo: required` in your `.travis.yml` file.

Thank you!
